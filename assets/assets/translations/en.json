    "content_3": "VO₂max (Maximum Oxygen Uptake) is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. It is widely regarded as the gold standard for measuring aerobic fitness and endurance capacity.\n\nA higher VO₂max indicates greater efficiency in delivering oxygen to your muscles, allowing you to sustain physical activity for longer and at higher intensities. It’s a critical metric for assessing overall cardiovascular and respiratory efficiency.",
    "title_4": "Running Economy",
    "content_4": "Running Economy refers to the amount of energy your body uses to maintain a certain running speed. It’s a measure of how efficiently you convert oxygen into movement during running.\n\nBetter running economy means you use less energy (and oxygen) to run at the same speed, allowing you to run farther or faster with the same effort. Factors influencing running economy include biomechanics, muscle efficiency, and physiological adaptations. It’s a crucial metric for optimizing performance, especially in long-distance running.",
    "title_5": "Lactate Threshold",
    "content_5": "Lactate Threshold (LT) is the intensity where lactate builds up faster than it can be cleared, marking the shift from aerobic to anaerobic effort.\n\nLTP (Lactate Threshold Pace) is the running pace at this threshold, crucial for optimizing endurance and pacing strategies during training and races. Training at your LTP helps improve performance and sustain higher intensities for longer.",
    "title_6": "Respiratory Metrics:",
    "content_6": "Imagine knowing exactly how efficiently your body delivers oxygen to your muscles and manages carbon dioxide during exercise. With PACER’s advanced tracking, you gain insights that go beyond the surface, helping you breathe better, train smarter, and push your limits.",
